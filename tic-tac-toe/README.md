# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This project is a simple console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in C++. It is a project for the CS200 course. The game allows two players to play Tic-Tac-Toe on a 3x3 grid, taking turns to mark X and O on the board. The game checks for a winner or a draw after each move.

## Features

- Two-player mode
- Simple console-based interface
- Checks for win or draw conditions

## Getting Started

## How to Play

1. The game starts with an empty 3x3 grid.
2. Players take turns to enter their moves.
3. A move consists of entering the row and column numbers to place their mark (X or O) on the grid.
4. The game checks for a win or draw after each move.
5. The game ends when a player wins or the board is full (draw).
