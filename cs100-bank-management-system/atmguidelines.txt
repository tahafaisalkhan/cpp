ATM
Taha Faisal Khan
CS100 - Final Project Program Guidelines

Functionality:
The ATM opens up a panel which reads multiple different character inputs. For a user who does not have an account, c is inputted. 
The user then inputs their desired 4-digit pin and their initial balance. They will then be presented with a credit card number which 
they would have to note down for any future transactions within this ATM. Multiple users can try multiple operations with their
respective card numbers/pins.

Taking advantage of other functions of the ATM is easy for the user. After inputting either w, d, l, p or e, the ATM will take the user 
to the validation panel where they input their account details. Once their account is found (if it is not, it will take the user back to 
the main panel) they can carry out their operation. Every operation has a display window that shows what change in balance took place. 
This stays on screen for 5 seconds before moving back to the main input panel.

Requesting a loan will add value to your unpaid loan but DOES NOT add value to your current balance. Every time a loan is taken, the 
overall unpaid loan increases.

The ATM can only be exited from the main panel by inputting e.


Functions:
•	Void updatefile: This is the main function that is used to do the file handling throughout the program. Every time either the balance 
or loan is updated, the updatefile updates these values within the datafiles for future use
•	Void interface: This introduces the main interface for the function
•	Void adduser: Used to add new users to the datafiles. It also generates a random 11-digit credit card number for the user
•	Bool validation: The validation panel that shows up before every operation within the ATM. Checks whether the credit card number for 
the user exists.
•	Int withdraw: Withdrawing money operation for the user
•	Int deposit: Depositing money operation for the user
•	Int loan: For taking loan and calculating total loan for the user
•	Void statement: Gives the current state of the user’s balance and loan


Important Notes
•	System clear and system color functions are used that are Windows OS specific. If run on Mac or Linux, the program WILL run but every 
time the display is shown, there will be an error command reading:
				sh: cls: command not found 
•	The datafile.txt and datatemp.txt file must be in the correct directories for the programme to run properly. Without these, user will 
not be able to access any accounts.

in case card not found error showing multiple times, data files need to be wiped clean
